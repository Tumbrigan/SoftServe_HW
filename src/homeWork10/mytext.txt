THIS chapter describes the context-free grammars used in this specification to
define the lexical and syntactic structure of a program.
2.1 Context-Free Grammars
A context-free grammar consists of a number of productions. Each production has
an abstract symbol called a nonterminal as its left-hand side, and a sequence of
one or more nonterminal and terminal symbols as its right-hand side. For each
grammar, the terminal symbols are drawn from a specified alphabet.
Starting from a sentence consisting of a single distinguished nonterminal, called the
goal symbol, a given context-free grammar specifies a language, namely, the set of
possible sequences of terminal symbols that can result from repeatedly replacing
any nonterminal in the sequence with a right-hand side of a production for which
the nonterminal is the left-hand side.
2.2 The Lexical Grammar

A lexical grammar for the Java programming language is given in §3 (Lexical
Structure). This grammar has as its terminal symbols the characters of the Unicode
character set. It defines a set of productions, starting from the goal symbol Input
(§3.5), that describe how sequences of Unicode characters (§3.1) are translated into
a sequence of input elements (§3.5).
These input elements, with white space (§3.6) and comments (§3.7) discarded,
form the terminal symbols for the syntactic grammar for the Java programming
language and are called tokens (§3.5). These tokens are the identifiers (§3.8),
